- Edit the comments of my functions DONE
    - Don't need "this function does ..." DONE
    - Add in line breaks DONE
    - Look over different libraries and model my comments off of how they do theirs DONE
- Make a separate module for just the header stuff, then have the other modules call from that DONE
- Use full instrument for the LSST instrumentation DONE
    - 1 kpc distance - just basic values for the inclination, azimuth etc. Will experiment with the values later DONE

- Change units from Jy to ergs MOVED
- Do a run with 0.25 for the extraction radius DONE
- Create a plotting module MOVED
    - within this, add in the options of overplotting stars or no - should be easy to add in MOVED
- Create a sanity check module MOVED

7/1/25
- Change units from Jy to ergs 
- Create a plotting module 
    - within this, add in the options of overplotting stars or no - should be easy to add in 
- Create a sanity check module 

- Do the meshoid examples.
- Do all snapshots but only one orientation (xy) now and follow how his colorbars are. Only do the cloud size for now for all of them (could also do 20% or a quarter to test)
- Double check units cause it should be squared not 3
- Change msun/au3 to msun/pc^3.

7/4/25
- Look at the default units in the header and look at Mike's Starforge tools to see the default units
- Overplot the stars on the meshoid plot I made. 
- Find min and max values for the meshoid data and use that to pick the limits. 
- Fix units on meshoid plot
